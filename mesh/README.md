# Mesh
This directory contains different finite element meshes (in different subdirectories).
For the publication (https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04916) "plate_elliptic_holes" was used. The mesh was generated in Abaqus.
The function `mesh_info` generates important information for a given finite element mesh.
