# `FEA_PLATE_ELLIPTIC_HOLES` - executes finite element analysis
###  Comments
Finite element data is saved as a structural array. The material, mesh
and boundary conditions have to be specified by the user. Set `testcase = true` and `material = vonMises` for a computationally inexpensive example.

Assumptions:

+   two-dimensional
    
+   plane stress
    
+   no body force
    
+   only homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions
    
+   displacement control
    
###  Input Arguments
