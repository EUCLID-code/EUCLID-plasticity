# Material
This directory contains different materials and their material parameters. The material parameters are stored in structural arrays.

- "FYS" indicates a material that has a "Fourier-type Yield Surface".
- "HardIsoLin" indicates a material with "Linear Isotropic Hardening".
- "HardIsoNonlin" indicates a material with "Nonlinear Isotropic Hardening".
- "HardMix" indicates a material with "Mixed isotropic and kinematic Hardening".
- "lib_VEVPHardMixLin" indicates a "ViscoElastic" and "ViscoPlastic" material with "Linear Mixed isotropic and kinematic Hardening".
